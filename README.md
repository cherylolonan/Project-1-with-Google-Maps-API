The purpose of this program is to provide the user with a method for searching superheroes. The user searches for a certain superhero and all their basic information is displayed. There is also a map in which the user can type in their zip code and it will display the closest comic book store in San Diego.

This is code I worked on for the map functionality of our project. It was eventually abandoned because it was not fully functional as it located other entertainment locations rather than scecifically comic book stores. A lot of effort was put into getting to this point and I plan to make it function as hoped.
